A Visualization of Santa Monica Parking data 

## Background

As promised, here is an RStudio project for y'all to figure out how
to integrate with data from the Socrata open data portal, and how to
build animations and visualizations.

## Files

retrieve.R -> This will retrieve the parking data. It takes a long
time and I wouldn't do it if I were you, unless you really want
the latest data.

build.R -> This builds the animation! Tweak it, play with it, have
a great time.
